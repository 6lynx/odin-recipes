			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In a large pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 5-7 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the grated carrot and potato (if using), and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Add the Tomato Paste and Spices:</strong> Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, paprika, and dried mint (if using). Cook for 1-2 minutes to allow the spices to release their flavors.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Cook the Lentils:</strong> Add the rinsed red lentils to the pot, followed by the vegetable or chicken broth (or water). Stir everything together and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are fully cooked and soft.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Blend the Soup (Optional):</strong> Once the lentils are tender, you can either leave the soup chunky or use an immersion blender to puree the soup for a smooth texture. You can also transfer the soup to a blender in batches if you don’t have an immersion blender.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Adjust the Consistency:</strong> If the soup is too thick, add a little more broth or water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Season:</strong> Taste the soup and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice for brightness.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with fresh parsley (if desired), and serve with a wedge of lemon on the side for extra flavor.</li>
