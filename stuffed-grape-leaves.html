    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Turkish Stuffed Grape Leaves, or Yaprak Sarma, is a delicious and savory dish made from grape leaves stuffed with a flavorful rice filling. The rice is seasoned with herbs, spices, and sometimes ground meat, then wrapped and simmered to create a tender, aromatic bite. This dish is often served as an appetizer or a side, and it's a perfect representation of Turkish cuisine's love for fresh ingredients and aromatic flavors.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 jar of grape leaves (about 30-40 leaves, rinsed and drained)</li>
        <li>1 cup rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried mint</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pine nuts (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup currants or raisins (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for about 5 minutes until softened. Add the rice and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring to coat it in the oil. Stir in the paprika, dried mint, cinnamon (if using), salt, and pepper. Add the pine nuts, currants, and tomato paste. Pour in the hot water or vegetable broth and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the rice is partially cooked and has absorbed most of the liquid. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>

        <li><strong>Stuff the Grape Leaves:</strong> Lay out the grape leaves on a flat surface, shiny side down. Place a spoonful of the rice mixture in the center of each leaf. Fold in the sides and roll the leaf up tightly around the filling, similar to a burrito. Repeat until all the leaves and filling are used.</li>

        <li><strong>Cook the Stuffed Grape Leaves:</strong> Place the rolled grape leaves in a large pot, seam side down. Arrange them in a circular pattern, stacking them as needed. Pour enough water to cover the leaves and drizzle with a bit of olive oil. Cover with a plate to keep them submerged. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 40-50 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the leaves are tender.</li>

        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let the stuffed grape leaves cool slightly before serving. Drizzle with lemon juice and serve with a side of yogurt for a refreshing contrast.</li>
    </ul>
